arrays - print

Write a method named print that accepts an array of integers as a parameter and prints them, one per line, in the format shown. 
Your code should work for an array of any size. For example, if an array named a contains the elements [32, 5, 27, -3, 2598], then the call of print(a); should produce the following output:

element [0] is 32
element [1] is 5
element [2] is 27
element [3] is -3
element [4] is 2598

 public static void print(int[] nums) {
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("element [" + i + "] is " + nums[i]);
        }
    }
