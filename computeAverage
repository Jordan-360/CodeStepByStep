arrays - computeAverage

Write a method named computeAverage that computes and returns the mean of all elements in an array of integers. For example, if an array named a contains [1, -2, 4, -4, 9, -6, 16, -8, 25, -10], 
then the call of computeAverage(a) should return 2.5.

Constraints: You may assume that the array contains at least one element. Your method should not modify the elements of the array.

    public static double computeAverage(int[] nums)  {
       int sum = 0;
       for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
           sum += nums[i];
       }
       return (double) sum / nums.length;
    }
