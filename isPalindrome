strings : isPalindrome 

Write a method named isPalindrome that accepts a string parameter and returns true if that string is a palindrome, 
or false if it is not a palindrome.

For this problem, a palindrome is defined as a string that contains exactly the same sequence of characters forwards as backwards, case-insensitively. For example, "madam" or "racecar" are palindromes, so the call of isPalindrome("racecar") would return true. Spaces, punctuation, and any other characters should be treated the same as letters; so a multi-word string such as "dog god" could be a palindrome, as could a gibberish string such as "123 $$ 321". The empty string and all one-character strings are palindromes by our definition.
Your code should ignore case, so a string like "Madam" or "RACEcar" would also count as palindromes.

 public static boolean isPalindrome(String str) {
        String ignoredCase = str.toLowerCase();
        int endIndex = str.length() - 1;

        for(int i = 0; i <= endIndex; i++) {
            if (ignoredCase.charAt(i) != ignoredCase.charAt(endIndex)) {
                return false;
            }
            endIndex--;
        }
        return true;
    }
